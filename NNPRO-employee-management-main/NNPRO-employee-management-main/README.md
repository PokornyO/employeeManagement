# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a semester assignment aimed at designing and implementing a robust web-based platform to help companies communicate effectively with employees, track their tasks and performance, plan work activities, and evaluate employees. The platform includes features for monitoring both team and individual performance and provides useful tools for managing work-related activities.

The project is divided into the following directories:

- **`design/`**: Contains resources related to the system's design, such as architectural diagrams.
- **`documentation/`**: Includes technical documentation and user's guide.
- **`implementation/`**: Contains the core application, divided into:
    - **`frontend/`**: The client-side part of the application, providing the user interface.
    - **`backend/`**: The server-side part of the application, handling business logic, APIs, and data management.
